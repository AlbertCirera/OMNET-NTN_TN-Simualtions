# OMNET-NTN_TN-Simulations
The code, simulation files, and data used in the study: Hybrid Non-Terrestrial and Terrestrial Networks: A Simulation Study for IoT Scalability and Protocol Performance
To test these simulation environments, you must install OMNeT++ along with the INET library. There are five base simulations, which you can modify by changing the protocols and the IoT devices to create new environments. You will need the complete set of files for each simulation.
